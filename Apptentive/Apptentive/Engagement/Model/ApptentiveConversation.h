 An `ApptentiveConversation` object stores data related to a conversation. It is
 intended to encompass all of the data necessary for an invocation to determine
 whether an interaction should be shown.
 
 In the most typical case, the conversation object will be unarchived from disk.
 
 If older conversation data (stored primarily in `NSUserDefaults`) is present,
 it can be migrated using the `-initAndMigrate` method.
 
 Finally, if this is a fresh installation of the SDK, the `-initWithAPIKey:`
 method should be used.
