# Apptentive iOS SDK

**Note: This repository hosts Versions 5.3.4 and earlier. Version 6.0 is now available at https://github.com/apptentive/apptentive-kit-ios**

The Apptentive iOS SDK provides a simple and powerful channel to communicate in-app with your customers.

Use Apptentive features to improve your app's App Store ratings, collect and respond to customer feedback, show surveys at specific points within your app, and more.

See our [Quick Start Guide](https://learn.apptentive.com/knowledge-base/ios-quick-start/) to get up and running as quickly as possible. 

For complete information on installing and using Apptentive, please see our [iOS integration reference](https://learn.apptentive.com/knowledge-base/ios-integration-reference/).

## Installation

Apptentive can be installed using CocoaPods or Carthage, or manually as an Xcode subproject. 

 - [CocoaPods installation guide](https://learn.apptentive.com/knowledge-base/ios-integration-reference/#cocoapods)
 - [Carthage installation guide](https://learn.apptentive.com/knowledge-base/ios-integration-reference/#carthage)

## Using Apptentive in your App

To begin, you will have to [initialize the Apptentive SDK](https://learn.apptentive.com/knowledge-base/ios-integration-reference/#initialize-apptentive):

``` objective-c
@import Apptentive;
...
ApptentiveConfiguration = [ApptentiveConfiguration configurationWithApptentiveKey:@"<#Your Apptentive App Key#>" apptentiveSignature:@"<#Your Apptentive App Signature#>"];
[Apptentive registerWithConfiguration:configuration];
...
[Apptentive.shared engage:@"event_name", from: viewController];
```

Or, in Swift:

``` Swift
import Apptentive
...
if let configuration = ApptentiveConfiguration(apptentiveKey: "<#Your Apptentive App Key#>", apptentiveSignature: "<#Your Apptentive App Signature#>") {
	Apptentive.register(with: configuration)
}
...
Apptentive.shared.engage(event: "event_name", from: viewController)
```

Later, on your Apptentive dashboard, you will target these events with Apptentive features such as Message Center, Ratings Prompts, and Surveys.
